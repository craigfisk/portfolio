Note: These essays were AI-generated on gemini.google.com using prompts I supplied, and then re-written to cut wordiness. Current work: When I wrote the first one, in early 2024, I had just finished a Google Developer Group - San Jose 5-week online session on LLM programming (Gemini, chatGPT, Hugging Face, Docker, Gitpod). Currently, in late 2025, we have put https://marmalade.ai on pause -- not least because it needs to have a social strategy. Also, the prototype needs to be  converted from Vue 2 to Vue 3, and subscription support using cloud functions needs to be added.


## Market Segmentation Using Unsupervised Machine Learning

<img src="https://craigfisk.com/img/pexels-photo-8613146_cropped_1080.png" style="width: 100%; height: float: right;" >

There are many publications on using machine learning in segmentation. This post is a personalized summary of some of my thinking on this topic. To build a new business is the #1 initiative today, according to a McKinsey & Company "Global Survey." 

Context: back in 2017 I arrived early for a talk on AI and spotted a software engineer I knew had been active in AI for a long time, so I asked what was new. He said, well, matrix algebra and regression are still relevant, but that there are 10,000 times more data and 10,000 times more compute power. 

Unsupervised ML does bring something new to the table, however. It is the method to use when there are no labels or predetermined categories. Supervised ML uses labeled data. Labeled data generally is lacking in marketing segmentation (or at least it would be good to leave existing ideas behind).

Unsupervised ML enables finding segments that were less than obvious in the data. This can lead to innovation.

### How Does Unsupervised Segmentation Work?
Unsupervised ML segmentation identifies clusters of data points that share similar characteristics, without prior knowledge of what the groupings are. This is especially  useful for exploratory data analysis. The goal there is to discover underlying patterns and relationships that might otherwise remain hidden. 

By grouping data into meaningful segments, companies can gain a deeper understanding of the customer base, market dynamics, and operating patterns, leading to more targeted marketing campaigns, improved customer service, and enhanced operational efficiency.

### Unsupervised Segmentation Techniques
Among the most popular unsupervised machie learning techniques:

*K-Means Clustering*: Divides data into a predefined number of clusters (k), iteratively assigning data points to the closest cluster centroid.

*Hierarchical Clustering*: Constructs a hierarchy of clusters by merging or splitting data points based on their similarity, resulting in a tree-like structure that reveals nested segments.

*Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise*: Identifies clusters based on the density of data points, allowing for the detection of clusters of varying shapes and sizes, including those that may be outliers or noise in other methods.

Each algorithm has its strengths and limitations. The choice of method depends on the characteristics of the data and the desired outcome.

###  Practical Applications of Unsupervised Segmentation
Unsupervised ML segmentation has a wide range of applications, including:

*Customer Segmentation*: Identifying distinct customer groups based on demographics, purchase behavior, and preferences, enabling targeted marketing campaigns and personalized customer experiences.

*Market Segmentation*: Uncovering market segments based on product preferences, demographics, and behavioral patterns, allowing for tailored product development and marketing strategies.

### Real-World Success Stories
Many companies have employed unsupervised ML segmentation to gain a competitive edge. For instance, a leading *e-commerce* company used unsupervised ML to identify customer segments based on purchase history and website behavior, resulting in an increase in conversion through product recommendations that targeted those segments.

### Embracing Unsupervised Segmentation for Strategic Advantage
As the volume and complexity of data continue to grow, unsupervised ML segmentation will play an increasing role in organizational decision-making. By leveraging the power of unsupervised ML to uncover hidden patterns and segments within data, organizations can gain a deeper understanding of their customers, markets, and operations, enabling them to make more informed strategic decisions and achieve a competitive advantage.

<img src="https://craigfisk.com/img/pexels-yan-krukau-6817650_1080.png" style="width: 50%; height: auto; float: right;" >

For me personally, this story is about leveraging expertise networking, similar to what we are doing with my startup, Marmalade AI, but applied to the large footprint of an existing product, *QuickBooks". There are, however, many similar cases that differentiate an established product by enabling its users to connect.

Intuit *QuickBooks* has established itself as a market-leading financial management solution for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). As the *QuickBooks* portfolio expands, so does the demand for experts. To address this opportunity, Intuit can innovate by enabling users to share expertise. Intuit can differentiate itself from competition with virtual expertise networks powered by machine learning (ML).

QuickBooks Expert Networks (QENs) connect *QuickBooks* users with relevant experts. They  provide a collaborative environment for knowledge exchange and problem-solving. 

ML plays a pivotal role: facilitate these connections by identifying patterns and connections within the vast user base and knowledge repositories. By analyzing user interactions, support requests, and product usage data, ML can discern expertise areas, learning styles, and communication preferences, enabling targeted connections between users and experts.

The implementation of ML-powered QENs offers compelling benefits for Intuit and *QuickBooks* users:
